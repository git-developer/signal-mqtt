# signal-mqtt
Docker image to send and receive messages for the [Signal](https://signal.org/) messenger via MQTT.

## How to use
1. Register or link your Signal account.
1. Configure and start a container.
1. Send and receive messages via MQTT.

## Quick start
1. Create a run configuration `docker-compose.yml`, e.g.:
    ```yaml
    ---
    services:
      signal-mqtt:
        image: ckware/signal-mqtt
        container_name: signal-mqtt
        restart: unless-stopped
        init: true
        user: "nobody:nogroup"
        environment:
          MQTT_PUBLISH_OPTIONS: "-h broker -i signal-receiver"
          MQTT_SUBSCRIBE_OPTIONS: "-h broker -i signal-sender"
        volumes:
        - "./data:/home/.local/share/signal-cli"
    ```

2. Start a container:
    ```sh
    $ docker-compose up -d
    ```

3. Send and receive messages:
    ```sh
    $ mosquitto_sub -v -h broker -t 'signal/#' &
    signal/in/method/receive/source_number/%2B491713920000/timestamp/1577882096000 Incoming message
    $ mosquitto_pub -v -h broker -t signal/out/method/send/recipient/%2B491713920000 -m 'Outgoing message'
    signal/out/method/send/recipient/%2B491713920000 Outgoing message
    ```

## Requirements
* A phone number that is registered as a Signal account
  (see [Registration with captcha](https://github.com/AsamK/signal-cli/wiki/Registration-with-captcha))
* Docker Compose


  The Docker Compose [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
  contains a comprehensive guide explaining several install options.
  On recent debian-based systems, Docker Compose may be installed by calling
  ```sh
  $ sudo apt install docker-compose
  ```

## Topic formatting
MQTT topics have the following structure by default:

  _\<PREFIX>_`/`_\<DIRECTION>_`/method/`_\<METHOD>_[`/`_\<PARAMETER_NAME>_`/`_\<PARAMETER_VALUE>_]...

- A prefix, defaulting to `signal`
- The direction, defaulting to either `in` or `out`
- The rpc method, e.g. `send` or `receive`
- An optional list of parameters
  - Each parameter consists of a name and a value.
  - The name is a simple text.
  - The value is either a scalar value or a comma-separated list of scalar values.
    The value may be suffixed by a type-id if required.
    All scalar values are percent-encoded.

### Percent encoding
Some of the values, e.g. international account numbers and base64 encoded group ids,
may include special characters which are forbidden as part of an MQTT topic.
Thus, all values in MQTT topics are percent-encoded (aka URL-encoded).

Example: topic `signal/out/method/send/recipient/%2B491713920000` contains parameter _recipient_ with value `+491713920000`.

Characters with a special meaning in the context of MQTT, base64 and percent-encoding include:

| Character | Percent Encoding |
| ---       | ---      |
|    `#`    |  `%23`   |
|    `$`    |  `%24`   |
|    `%`    |  `%25`   |
|    `+`    |  `%2B`   |
|    `,`    |  `%2C`   |
|    `/`    |  `%2F`   |
|    `=`    |  `%3D`   |

### Explicit typing
By default, a parameter's type is derived from its value.
When the default type does not match the expected type,
the value must be suffixed by a colon (`:`) and a type-id:

_\<PARAMETER>_`/`_\<PERCENT_ENCODED_VALUE>_`:`_\<TYPE_ID>_

Some parameters allow multiple values;
these may be represented by a comma-separated list of multiple values:

_\<PARAMETER>_`/`_\<PERCENT_ENCODED_VALUE1>_`,`_\<PERCENT_ENCODED_VALUE2>_`:`_\<TYPE_ID>_

Type Rules:

- The supported type-ids are `string`, `number`, `boolean`.
  Each type-id may be suffixed with `[]` which means that the value is a list.
- When a value contains digits only, its default type is `number`, otherwise `string`.
- The type-id may be abbreviated.
  For example, `string`, `str` and `s` are all valid type-ids for type `string`, 
- In a comma-separated value list, the type-id suffix `[]` may be omitted.

| Type      | type-id     | JSON syntax      | Topic syntax
| ---       | ---         | ---              |  ---
| String    | `string`    | `"foo"`          | `foo` or `foo:s` or `foo:string`
| Number    | `number`    | `123`            | `123` or `123:n` or `123:number`
| Boolean   | `boolean`   | `true`           | `true:b` or `true:boolean`
| String[]  | `string[]`  | `["foo", "bar"]` | `foo,bar` or `foo,bar:s` or `foo,bar:s[]` or `foo,bar:string[]`
|           |             | `["foo"]`        | `foo:s[]`
| Number[]  | `number[]`  | `[123, 456]`     | `123,456` or `123,456:n` or `123,456:n[]` or `123,456:number[]`
|           |             | `[123]`          | `123:n[]`
| Boolean[] | `boolean[]` | `[true, false]`  | `true,false:b` or `true,false:b[]`
|           |             | `[true]`         | `true:b[]` 

Example:
- Topic: `signal/out/method/send/recipient/%2B491713920000,%2B491713920001/quoteTimestamp/1577882096000:n`
- Parameter _recipient_ contains a `string` array of the two phone numbers `+491713920000` and `+491713920001`;
  parameter _quoteTimestamp_ is explicitely typed as `number` (although the default would work here, too).
