# signal-mqtt
Docker image to send and receive messages for the [Signal](https://signal.org/) messenger via MQTT.

## How to use
1. Register or link your Signal account.
1. Configure and start a container.
1. Send and receive messages via MQTT.

## Quick start
1. Create a run configuration `docker-compose.yml`, e.g.:
    ```yaml
    ---
    services:
      signal-mqtt:
        image: ckware/signal-mqtt
        container_name: signal-mqtt
        restart: unless-stopped
        init: true
        user: "nobody:nogroup"
        environment:
          MQTT_PUBLISH_OPTIONS: "-h broker -i signal-receiver"
          MQTT_SUBSCRIBE_OPTIONS: "-h broker -i signal-sender"
        volumes:
        - "./data:/home/.local/share/signal-cli"
    ```

2. Start a container:
    ```sh
    $ docker-compose up -d
    ```

3. Send and receive messages:
    ```sh
    $ mosquitto_sub -v -h broker -t 'signal/#' &
    signal/receive/%2B491713920000 Incoming message
    $ mosquitto_pub -v -h broker -t signal/send/%2B491713920000 -m 'Outgoing message'
    signal/send/%2B491713920000 Outgoing message
    ```

## Requirements
* A phone number that is registered as a Signal account
  (see [Registration with captcha](https://github.com/AsamK/signal-cli/wiki/Registration-with-captcha))
* Docker Compose


  The Docker Compose [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
  contains a comprehensive guide explaining several install options.
  On recent debian-based systems, Docker Compose may be installed by calling
  ```sh
  $ sudo apt install docker-compose
  ```

## Commands

### Lifecycle commands
| Action | Command
| ------ | -------
| Start the container | `docker-compose up -d`
| Stop the container  | `docker-compose down`
| View the logs       | `docker-compose logs -f `

### MQTT commands
The following values are used in the examples:
* Account number of signal-mqtt: `+493023125000`
* Phone number: `+491713920000`
* Hostname of the MQTT broker: `broker`
* Group Name: _Admins_
* Group ID: `LS0+YWRtaW5zPz8/Cg==`

#### Percent encoding in MQTT topics
Some of the values, e.g. international account numbers and base64 encoded group ids,
may include special characters which are forbidden as part of an MQTT topic.
Thus, all values in MQTT topics are percent-encoded (aka URL-encoded).

Characters with a special meaning in the context of MQTT, base64 and percent-encoding include:

| Character | Percent  |
|           | Encoding |
| ---       | ---      |
|    `#`    |  `%23`   |
|    `$`    |  `%24`   |
|    `%`    |  `%25`   |
|    `+`    |  `%2B`   |
|    `/`    |  `%2F`   |
|    `=`    |  `%3D`   |


#### Send a text message
* Topic: `<TOPIC_PREFIX>/<MQTT_SUBSCRIBE_TOPIC>/<PHONE_NUMBER>`
* Example:
  ```sh
  $ mosquitto_pub -h broker -t signal/send/%2B491713920000 -m 'Outgoing message'
  ```
  The text _Outgoing message_ is sent to the phone.

#### Receive a text message
* Topic: `<TOPIC_PREFIX>/<MQTT_PUBLISH_TOPIC>/<PHONE_NUMBER>/timestamp/<TIMESTAMP>`
* Example:
  The text _Incoming message_ is sent from the phone to `+493023125000`.
  ```sh
  $ mosquitto_sub -v -h broker -t signal/#
  signal/receive/%2B491713920000/timestamp/1577882096000 Incoming message
  ```

#### Receive a text message without timestamp
* Topic: `<TOPIC_PREFIX>/<MQTT_PUBLISH_TOPIC>/<PHONE_NUMBER>`
* Required configuration option: `MQTT_PUBLISH_PER_SOURCE_TIMESTAMP: "false"`
* Example:
  The text _Incoming message_ is sent from the phone to `+493023125000`.
  ```sh
  $ mosquitto_sub -v -h broker -t signal/#
  signal/receive/%2B491713920000 Incoming message
  ```

#### Receive a message in JSON format
* Topic: `<TOPIC_PREFIX>/<MQTT_PUBLISH_TOPIC>/<PHONE_NUMBER>`
* Required configuration option: `MQTT_PUBLISH_PER_SOURCE_AS_JSON: "true"`
* Note: To suppress publishing of the same message in text format, additionally set `MQTT_PUBLISH_PER_SOURCE_AS_TEXT: "false"`
* Example:
  The text _Incoming message_ is sent from the phone to `+493023125000`.
  ```sh
  $ mosquitto_sub -v -h broker -t signal/#
  signal/receive/%2B491713920000 {"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"receive","params":{"envelope":{"source":"+491713920000","sourceNumber":"+491713920000","sourceUuid":"3689ed97-01b2-4fa5-8ed8-18174ad5cf15","sourceName":"Sally Sender","sourceDevice":1,"timestamp":1577882096000,"dataMessage":{"timestamp":1577882096000,"message":"Incoming message","expiresInSeconds":0,"viewOnce":false}},"account":"+493023125000","subscription":0}}
  signal/receive/%2B491713920000/timestamp/1577882096000 Incoming message
  ```

#### Send a text message to a group
* Topic: `<TOPIC_PREFIX>/<MQTT_SUBSCRIBE_TOPIC>/group/<GROUP_ID>`
* Note: The group-id must be percent-encoded.
  A group-id (which is base64 encoded) may be converted to percent encoding by applying the following replacements:
  - `+` (plus) becomes `%2B`
  - `/` (slash) becomes `%2F`
  - `=` (equals) becomes `%3D`
* Example:
  ```sh
  $ mosquitto_pub -h broker -t signal/send/group/LS0%2BYWRtaW5zPz8%2FCg%3D%3D -m 'Outgoing message'
  ```
  The text _Outgoing message_ is sent to the group _Admins_.

#### Receive a text message from a group
* Topic: `<TOPIC_PREFIX>/<MQTT_PUBLISH_TOPIC>/<PHONE_NUMBER>/timestamp/<TIMESTAMP>/group/<GROUP_ID>`
* Example:
  The text _Incoming message_ is sent from the phone to the group _Admins_.
  ```sh
  $ mosquitto_sub -v -h broker -t signal/#
  signal/receive/%2B491713920000/timestamp/1577882096000/group/LS0%2BYWRtaW5zPz8%2FCg%3D%3D Incoming message
  ```

#### Receive a quotation message
* Topic: `<TOPIC_PREFIX>/<MQTT_PUBLISH_TOPIC>/<PHONE_NUMBER>/timestamp/<TIMESTAMP>/quote/<TIMESTAMP_OF_QUOTED_MESSAGE>`
* Example:
  The text _Incoming quote_ is sent from the phone as quotation to the message _Outgoing message_ from above.
  ```sh
  $ mosquitto_sub -v -h broker -t signal/#
  signal/receive/%2B491713920000/timestamp/1577882100000/quote/1577882096000 Incoming quote
  ```
* Note: the combination of group and quotation is possible within a single message.

#### Receive a reaction (emoji)
* Topic: `<TOPIC_PREFIX>/<MQTT_PUBLISH_TOPIC>/<PHONE_NUMBER>/timestamp/<TIMESTAMP>/reaction/<TIMESTAMP_OF_ORIGINAL_MESSAGE>`
* Example:
  The emoji üëç is sent from the phone as reaction to the message _Outgoing message_ from above.
  ```sh
  $ mosquitto_sub -v -h broker -t signal/#
  signal/receive/%2B491713920000/timestamp/1577882100000/reaction/1577882096000 üëç
  ```
* Note: the combination of group and reaction is possible within a single message.

#### Send a JSON-RPC message
* Topic: `<TOPIC_PREFIX>/<MQTT_SUBSCRIBE_TOPIC>`
* Example:
  ```sh
  $ mosquitto_pub -h broker -t signal/send -m '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"send","params":{"recipient":["+491713920000"],"message":"Outgoing message"}}'
  ```
  The text _Outgoing message_ is sent to the phone.

#### Receive JSON-RPC messages
* Topic: `<TOPIC_PREFIX>/<MQTT_PUBLISH_TOPIC>`
* Required configuration option: `MQTT_PUBLISH_JSON_RESPONSE: "true"`
* Example:
  ```sh
  $ mosquitto_sub -v -h broker -t 'signal/#' &
  # The user starts to type 'Incoming message' on the phone
  signal/receive {"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"receive","params":{"envelope":{"source":"+491713920000","sourceNumber":"+491713920000","sourceUuid":"3689ed97-01b2-4fa5-8ed8-18174ad5cf15","sourceName":"Sally Sender","sourceDevice":1,"timestamp":1577882080000,"typingMessage":{"action":"STARTED","timestamp":1577882080000}},"account":"+493023125000","subscription":0}}

#### Run a signal-cli command
* Syntax: 
  ```sh
  $ docker-compose run signal-mqtt signal-cli <command>
  ```
* Example:
  ```sh
  $ docker-compose run --rm -ti signal-mqtt signal-cli listContacts
  Number: +491713920000 Name:  Profile name: Sally Sender Blocked: false Message expiration: disabled
  Number: +491713920001 Name:  Profile name: Rudy Receiver Blocked: false Message expiration: disabled
  ```
* Note: Most signal-cli commands require that no container is running.
